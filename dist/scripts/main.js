I began selling on-line and found I could control the hours I worked and still be creative while working from home. It allowed me to contribute to our family finances without having to regulate my hours like a standard store, but to be open for business 24 hrs a day.

A perfect gift for him in decorating that man cave, home bar, den, or garage with some classy bar themed wall art.  Inspired by Mad Men, this image of a poured cocktail is sure to help your man take the edge off.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\n\r\nVintage dictionary art is a unique process in which I &quot;upcycle&quot; old dictionaries by hand into a beautiful new piece of art.  The desirably yellowed pages of my vintage dictionaries present a classy and sophisticated look that works magic for any interior decorating project.  It doesn&#39;t matter if your style is modern, vintage, or for the college dorm.  Each print comes on a different page of the dictionary, so no two are alike.\r\n\r\nPAPER SIZE\r\n\r\nMy prints do not come framed or matted, however they are printed to perfectly fit them. I size the print window to fit either an 8x10 frame or a larger frame matted for an 8x10 opening. The dictionary pages themselves measure just shy of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;, which are the same dimensions as standard copy paper.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING\r\n\r\nAll of my prints ship in durable cardboard mailers via USPS First Class Mail.  Prints will ship within 1-3 business days of your order, but in most cases, I am able to ship the next day.\r\n\r\n\u00a9 2013 DictionArt.

You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love\/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (6-8 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)\r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and\/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.

If you desire to clean your items upon receipt, please use care and research proper cleaning methods to preserve condition and avoid damage.\r\n\r\nVery minor &quot;flaws&quot; including as-manufactured flaws are to be expected in quality vintage items and may not be described in the listing; however, if I notice something unusual on inspection I will do my best to describe it accurately.  Where applicable, elastics are gently hand-stretched by me to make sure they have not lost their snap -- badly &quot;ruffled&quot; and dead elastics are not offered for sale.  Items with chips, stains, tears, missing or damaged pieces or other major flaws that interfere with the function or appeal of the piece are not offered for sale.

After 7 days the item will be relisted and you will lose your deposit.  PayPal is the only method of payment available for reserved orders.  This policy is necessary and not negotiable.\r\n\r\nA note on vintage lingerie.  It is not recommended that these items be dry-cleaned or washed in Woolite.  Liquid Ivory dish soap is a gentle alternative and is made to not strip moisture from your hands; it seems not to strip or dry-out your quality vintage lingerie either, leaving it supple and velvety instead.  You will love it!\r\n\r\nA note on vintage jewelry.  Vintage rhinestones including foil backed rhinestones are very delicate and must be cleaned with extreme care, preferably a dry method so as to not damage the foil backings.  In general, metal jewelry as well as glassware and various household items are best cleaned with distilled water and a bit of white vinegar on a soft brush or cloth and then gently patted dry.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer and legal statement: all items are offered  for sale in their found, secondhand condition and no warranties exist, express or implied, including warranty of merchantability and warranty for a particular purpose.

I do not generally clean or launder and leave this up to the new owner to clean or freshen as needed.  If you desire to clean your items upon receipt, please use care and research proper cleaning methods to preserve condition and avoid damage.\r\n\r\nVery minor &quot;flaws&quot; including as-manufactured flaws are to be expected in quality vintage items and may not be described in the listing; however, if I notice something unusual on inspection I will do my best to describe it accurately.  Where applicable, elastics are gently hand-stretched by me to make sure they have not lost their snap -- badly &quot;ruffled&quot; and dead elastics are not offered for sale.  Items with chips, stains, tears, missing or damaged pieces or other major flaws that interfere with the function or appeal of the piece are not offered for sale.

This policy is necessary and not negotiable.\r\n\r\nA note on vintage lingerie.  It is not recommended that these items be dry-cleaned or washed in Woolite.  Liquid Ivory dish soap is a gentle alternative and is made to not strip moisture from your hands; it seems not to strip or dry-out your quality vintage lingerie either, leaving it supple and velvety instead.  You will love it!\r\n\r\nA note on vintage jewelry.  Vintage rhinestones including foil backed rhinestones are very delicate and must be cleaned with extreme care, preferably a dry method so as to not damage the foil backings.  In general, metal jewelry as well as glassware and various household items are best cleaned with distilled water and a bit of white vinegar on a soft brush or cloth and then gently patted dry.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer and legal statement: all items are offered  for sale in their found, secondhand condition and no warranties exist, express or implied, including warranty of merchantability and warranty for a particular purpose.

Buyer is responsible for procuring any refund directly from the USPS.  Returns may or may not be accepted for items arriving late, please see below for returns policy.","policy_refunds":"To maintain quality, all non-clothing items are not returnable and are sold as is, all sales final.  The following items are NOT RETURNABLE:\r\n\r\n-Housewares;\r\n-Jewelry;\r\n-Furs;\r\n-NOS\/NWT New with Tags items with original tags or packaging missing, altered or removed;\r\n-All international orders;\r\n-Orders made using coupon codes or discounts.\r\n\r\nClothing items and shoes shipped domestically are returnable unless otherwise indicated.  In general, any clothing item(s) may be returned in its original condition within 7 days of confirmed delivery date for a full refund of the purchase price less a $10 processing fee per returned order.  Buyer pays return shipping via USPS Priority Mail including tracking and insurance and MUST message me and have the package postmarked, and send me the tracking number, within 7 calendar days of confirmed delivery date to receive a refund.  Funds will be promptly returned after the item(s) have been inspected.  This means buyer (you) pays shipping both ways plus a $10 processing fee.\r\n\r\nIf you feel I have grossly misrepresented a non-returnable item and you are not happy with it, please message me!\r\n\r\nLOST OR DAMAGED PACKAGES:  I have your back!  All items are insured through the USPS or a 3rd party carrier, or are self-insured by me.  I carefully and competently package all items, however...if your package arrives damaged, or if it has not arrived at all after 30 days, please message me right away to assist in the insurance claims process.  Please be aware that time limitations for insurance claims do apply, so do not hesitate!  After the claim has been timely completed and submitted, I will refund you directly for the purchase price plus original shipping.  Damaged items require close up and wide angle photographs of the outside of the package, the inside packing materials, the damaged item and the address label.  Lost item claims may require a notarized affidavit and\/or federal mail theft charge to be filed.","policy_additional":"All items are stored in my smoke-free home and are delivered to you in their quality, found condition.  I do not generally clean or launder and leave this up to the new owner to clean or freshen as needed.  If you desire to clean your items upon receipt, please use care and research proper cleaning methods to preserve condition and avoid damage.\r\n\r\nVery minor &quot;flaws&quot; including as-manufactured flaws are to be expected in quality vintage items and may not be described in the listing; however, if I notice something unusual on inspection I will do my best to describe it accurately.  Where applicable, elastics are gently hand-stretched by me to make sure they have not lost their snap -- badly &quot;ruffled&quot; and dead elastics are not offered for sale.  Items with chips, stains, tears, missing or damaged pieces or other major flaws that interfere with the function or appeal of the piece are not offered for sale.  If you are unhappy with any clothing item or shoes for any reason, including an actual or perceived flaw, please feel free to return it in accordance with my returns policy.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: I measure in inches from seam to seam, laid flat, unstretched, on the outside of the garment.  Collar means collar seam, shoulder means shoulder seam etc.\r\n\r\nReservations: Accepted October 1 though December 7 only.  I am happy to reserve any item for you upon receipt of a 30% nonrefundable deposit, just ask!  Full deposit amount will be credited toward your purchase so long as you complete the transaction within 7 days of the reservation date.  After 7 days the item will be relisted and you will lose your deposit.  PayPal is the only method of payment available for reserved orders.  This policy is necessary and not negotiable.\r\n\r\nA note on vintage lingerie.  It is not recommended that these items be dry-cleaned or washed in Woolite.  Liquid Ivory dish soap is a gentle alternative and is made to not strip moisture from your hands; it seems not to strip or dry-out your quality vintage lingerie either, leaving it supple and velvety instead.  You will love it!\r\n\r\nA note on vintage jewelry.  Vintage rhinestones including foil backed rhinestones are very delicate and must be cleaned with extreme care, preferably a dry method so as to not damage the foil backings.  In general, metal jewelry as well as glassware and various household items are best cleaned with distilled water and a bit of white vinegar on a soft brush or cloth and then gently patted dry.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer and legal statement: all items are offered  for sale in their found, secondhand condition and no warranties exist, express or implied, including warranty of merchantability and warranty for a particular purpose.  All items are offered as collectors&#39; items for adults only.  Buyers&#39; sole remedy against seller is the return policy as outlined above.  Buyers must be 18 years of age or older.

I hope you have found something that catches your eye. All my jewelry is handmade by me, with semi-precious gemstones, with a variety of sterling silver accents and components. \r\n\r\nCare and Maintenance: \r\nSterling silver is the primary metal in most of my pieces.  Sterling will need an occasional polish from wear and natural oxidation.  Polishing cloths can be found in many stores, and I highly recommend them, instead of the &quot;dunk and soak&quot; solutions.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nMost of my earrings run from about 1.2&quot; to 2.5&quot; in size - I specify the exact size in each listing description - I measure the total length of the earring including the wire - basically the size is &quot;from your ear hole&quot;.  \r\n\r\nNecklaces please select your choice. 18&quot; is the average length, but it&#39;s up to you.   \r\n\r\nShopping With Me:\r\nLike most sellers, I also shop and browse on Etsy, and probably a lot of the other places you do too - so I adopt a &quot;treat as you&#39;d like to be treated&quot; philosophy. I realize there are thousands of other items and sellers, and ultimately want you to feel glad you chose to click on my jewelry. \r\n\r\nLost an Earring?\r\nI provide plastic Clutch stoppers to help you keep them on your ears, but if needed, can often provide a replacement for single lost earrings for half the cost of the original pair plus shipping. This of course depends on my still having the same stones\/components, and I can&#39;t promise an EXACT match but I will work with you if needed.

Please let me know if a print(s) is(are) being sent as a gift! Please be aware that if large prints (11x14s) cannot be left in a mailbox, USPS may leave a slip in its place and you will have to get your order from the post office. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES\/DOMESTIC ORDERS - Once shipped you will receive an email notifying you along with tracking information. Usually prints take 2-5 business days to arrive. If things take longer I apologize, once things leave my hands they are out of my control.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS - Once shipped you will receive an email notifying you along with customs number. Orders can take anywhere from 1-3 weeks to arrive once shipped. You are responsible for any duties, customs, and taxes levied by your country.

Please let me know if you would like a gift receipt or a short hand written message included.\r\n\r\nLOST ORDERS\r\nWhile extremely rare, if a package ends up missing along it&#39;s travels to you, I am happy to send a replacement! Because mail can be delayed for a variety of reasons, I will wait 3 weeks from the original ship date of the first package for US orders, and 5 weeks for International orders before sending a replacement. Please let me know if you do not receive your package in that amount of time, otherwise I will assume you received your print(s).\r\n\r\nDAMAGED PRINTS\r\nI ship using rigid mailers to make sure that prints do not bend in transit. All envelops are also marked DO NOT BEND, however sometimes on rare occasions the post office or mail carrier can get a little rough. PLEASE let me know RIGHT AWAY when you get your print if it bent or damaged. I will have no idea otherwise and will assume all is well if I do not hear otherwise :)\r\n\r\nAny other problems please contact me via Etsy convo or email eatsaylove@gmail.com","policy_refunds":"EAT.SAY.LOVE. prints are made using high quality, long lasting materials and are carefully packaged and shipped. \r\n\r\nI do not accept returns simply because every thing is made to order. \r\nI also do not offer cash refunds, except under extraordinary circumstances.

Madame hustles her bustle from sunrise to sunset, and once those gates close for the night, she&#39;s more than ready to slip into that old clawfoot bath and sip a little whiskey. And this is no coffin varnish, mind you - Madame is terribly particular. Fine old whiskey ranks high on her list of favorites (just below chocolate and shoes, in fact). Although she shares her best bottle with precious few people, she doesn&#39;t see the harm in sharing the bouquet with you, dear reader.\r\n\r\nMadame has based this alluring scent on her favorite single barrel bourbon: delicate floral notes on top of richly aged wood and warm vanilla, earthy spice and the slightest hint of cherry and caramel.

Solid perfumes are for external use only. DO NOT use as lip balm, or on sensitive areas.\r\n\r\nAllergies:\r\nRead all ingredients carefully before ordering, please - especially if you have known allergies to certain fragrances. Please contact the Madame if you have any questions or concerns. She is generally very quick at replying.\r\n\r\nWholesale:\r\nMost items are available for wholesale, and custom orders are welcome.

We apologize that we have no control over this situation. Also please know your country&#39;s guidelines and restrictions for international packages. The most typical reason for packages held in customs is that an item contained within is prohibited by that country.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\nWe are perfectionists and we are pleasers. We receive very little negative feedback, and of course we&#39;d like to keep it that way!
