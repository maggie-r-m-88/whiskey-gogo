This will allow you to view, print and edit food labels (if you purchased them). If you have trouble with your files and receive a unsupported file type error, this is why. Any other PDF errors may be because your version of Adobe Reader needs an update. Always a good idea to check that first.\r\n\r\nLinks to your Instant Download files should arrive via Etsy within 5 minutes of purchase. If you have not received your files check Your Account &gt; Purchases &gt; Files to Download. \r\n\r\nSome files may be zipped because of size and will need to be unzipped so you can extract your files. To extract, either double-click the compressed folder or right-click the compressed folder, and then click Extract All. \r\n\r\nBecause they are instant and distributed immediately, they are sold as is and cannot be refunded, exchanged or returned. \r\n\r\nAlong with your file(s) you will find a PDF with a sheet of directions and a copyright release should you choose to print at a copy center or professional printer. Because items purchased, software, computer systems, etc. vary, directions and list of supplies are very general and should only be used as a guide. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am happy to help!\r\n\r\nMy shop is open Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. CT.

Instant downloads are available in some collections. They are delivered within 5 minutes via Etsy\u2019s automated process. https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/3LittleMonkeysStudio\/search?search_query=instant+download. INSTANT DOWNLOADS ARE NOT PERSONALIZED.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS HOURS\r\nEvenings, weekends and holidays (USA, Central time) are spent with my family. I may respond to emails if time allows, but I try to unplug and spend as much time as I can with my three little ones and husband. Though this is an online business, it doesn&#39;t mean I am online 24\/7. Messages are responded to during business hours, and weekend business resumes promptly on Monday. I appreciate your understanding.\r\n\r\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\r\nFor answers to questions about ordering, printing, assembly and more check out my Frequently Asked Questions at http:\/\/www.ThreeLittleMonkeysStudio.com\/faq\/","policy_payment":"I accept Etsy&#39;s Direct Checkout and PayPal. Orders cannot be filled until payment clears, so choose credit or debit for the fastest service. If funds do not clear, the order will be cancelled. ","policy_shipping":"Most of Three Little Monkeys Studio items are digital DIY files (see listing for specifics) and are not physical items or shipped. However, I do offer printing as an upgrade. Inquiries must be agreed to by me, a quote given and a printing upgrade purchased before printing is processed. Printed items are delivered using USPS or FEDEX. The carrier used varies based on the quantity and size of the item(s) and varies at my discretion. \r\n\r\nThree Little Monkeys Studio is not responsible for lost or damaged packages. No refunds will be given on shipped items. I package everything with love and personally hand it over to someone at the post office. Once that happens, I cross my fingers and am no longer responsible. Every package is shipped with insurance, and any claims filed are the buyers responsibility.","policy_refunds":"I sell on Etsy with the faith that my buyers will carefully read the listings they purchase, honor and respect my shop policies and business hours, and that they will provide accurate information for me to personalize their files. I also have faith that they will be respectful about things that I can and can&#39;t do, and will be respectful and reasonable when we resolve issues. I do everything possible to ensure my buyers are satisfied with their purchases. However, due to the custom nature of my products and the time invested in each order, all sales are final. Refunds or credits may be given at my sole discretion. Exchanges are not permitted.  \r\n\r\nCANCELLATIONS\r\nI reserve the right to cancel and refund transactions for rude or unreasonable buyers. It is unfortunate, but it does happen. I also reserve the right to cancel in the event a buyer provides no personalization details, is unreachable or unresponsive to requests for information required to complete the order.\r\n\r\nINSTANT DOWNLOADS ARE SOLD AS-IS\r\nNo refunds, color changes, substitutions or exchanges. Instant downloads are unpersonalized files, which is why they are &quot;instant&quot; and able to be sent right away. Etsy does not screen the &quot;notes to seller&quot; before they process, send and mark your order as complete, so please do not leave notes for changes. \r\n","policy_additional":"PROCESSING TIME\r\nCurrent turnaround time for personalized items is next business day once the payment and personalization details are received. Due to the custom nature of my artwork this is subject to change depending on volume of orders I receive. \r\n\r\nBUSINESS HOURS\r\nI work Monday-Friday, taking evening and weekends off to spend time with my family. Hours are typically 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (USA, Central time), though hours may be all over the place depending on kids, illnesses, etc. Though this is an online business, it does not mean I am at the computer 24\/7. Depending on work volume, time of day, etc., response times may vary. Please be patient and flexible.\r\n\r\nPERSONALIZATION DETAILS\r\nDouble-check the personalization information you submit. It will be transferred to your personalized item as-is with minimal typing to prevent errors. Please use proper capitalization. No one is perfect, so I will be happy to make up to two (2) complimentary revisions for you but cannot be held responsible for any errors. Please proof your file(s) ASAP. \r\n\r\nPRINTING INSTRUCTIONS, LIST OF SUPPLIES & PRINTING TIPS\r\nI send thorough printing instructions, a list of helpful (and optional) supplies and printing tips with every order. I know we are all in a rush, but reading those instructions will help you whether you are printing at home, a photo lab or a print service. I talk about options, sizes, materials and other things that are important. Skipping them can cause problems and misunderstandings. Please take a moment to read them BEFORE you print so you can get the best possible print.\r\n\r\nIt is important to make sure you have the most current version of Adobe Reader (free download\/upgrade at http:\/\/get.adobe.com\/reader\/) to view, print, and type into your mailing labels and food labels if you want them to look exactly as purchased. Having an old buggy version could result in font substitutions and other hassles. An upgrade takes 5 minutes and may save you some frustration.  \r\n\r\nCONVOS AND NOTES TO SELLER\r\nIf you have any questions, please convo BEFORE you buy. Placing questions or requests for changes in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; section at checkout causes delays, especially if your questions or requests are time sensitive in nature. The notes section attaches to the order and does not come directly to me like a convo or email would. Plus, any alterations\/substitutions\/changes require prior approval before purchasing, so please send questions or requests via Etsy convo or email before you buy to avoid unnecessary delays, cancellations, confusion and hassle.  \r\n\r\nDESIGN\r\nDo not assume text or colors can be changed on any item or that images or designs can be substituted for another. I personalize and send you the final files AS PICTURED and specified in the listings. Designs do not change from order to order, only the personalization details. I do not send the templates, artwork, or commercial fonts--just the finished, personalized and ready-to-print digital product. \r\n\r\nPHOTOS ARE USED AS-IS\r\nBecause I do not alter or change provided photos used in photo invitations, I am not responsible for problems associated with the color, blurriness, etc. in your photo provided. Only one photo will be placed. If you have trouble selecting a photo for your invitation, let me know and I can help you choose the best one for the space.\r\n\r\nDELIVERY OF PERSONALIZED DIGITAL ITEMS\r\nDigital orders are sent via file transfer service or email depending on the number of and file size of items purchased. They come to you as high-resolution digital JPEGs or PDFs, depending on the terms of the listing purchased (please refer to the listings for details about sizing and file types). Files may also be zipped for easier transfer. I choose the delivery and method that is best suited for your order. Please download files on your computer and not your smartphone or iPad for easier download, printing, etc.\r\n\r\nDELIVERY OF INSTANT (UNPERSONALIZED) DIGITAL ITEMS\r\nInstant downloads are processed immediately by Etsy (not by me personally), so if you purchased any of those, please check your inbox for a message from Etsy sent within 5 minutes of purchase (or your spam folder if it is missing). Or you may also log in to your account within a few minutes of purchase to download the instant files there. You can do that at Your Account &gt; Purchases and then click on the &quot;Download Files&quot; button. \r\n\r\nPlease note: This only applies to listings marked as being an &quot;instant download&quot; in the listing purchased. Party packs and other personalized packages follow the production time mentioned in the listing purchased, even if it may contain unpersonalized item(s). Personalized and unpersonalized items are not sent separately when part of a party pack. Only individual a la carte items marked &quot;Instant&quot; in their listing follow the instant download schedule.\r\n\r\nFORMAT & SIZE\r\nAll invitations are 5x7&quot; or 4x6&quot;. Invitations are high-resolution 300 dpi. The 5x7 size is a de facto standard across many of the sellers on Etsy, and it&#39;s a good option for customers who use home printers, photo labs and materials from office supply stores. Your invitation will come to you as a JPEG for easier printing across any medium. Printables come to you as 8.5x11&quot; PDFs for ease of home printing, with 1-12 items per page, depending on the size of the item (e.g., 3 water bottle labels per page, 12 party circles per page). No changes.\r\n\r\nCOLOR VARIATIONS IN PRINTERS, SCREENS\r\nAll screens and devices render colors differently. Designs and colors do not change from order to order. Because colors vary from printer to printer and computer monitor to computer monitor, and among ink and paper, there may be slight differences from what you see online and what pops out of your printer. Three Little Monkeys Studio is NOT responsible for assumptions about color, or matching items purchased from other shops or vendors.\r\n\r\nACCESS, PRINTING & TECHNOLOGY ISSUES\r\nThree Little Monkeys Studio is not responsible for software, printer or computer problems, problems at print services including uploading your files to Walmart\/OfficeMax\/etc., software issues, server outages, or employers blocking Etsy, file transfer services, etc. I cannot be held responsible for things that happen once I hand the files off to you. No refunds will be given. \r\n\r\nPrint services are getting more and more wary about printing digital items over concerns of copyright infringement and misuse (For example: well-known character or sports team invitations that sellers do not have permission to sell are often refused. FYI, I do not sell those.). Print services do have the right to refuse you service even if the employee is absolutely in the wrong. Now, this scenario is extremely rare and my customers print there all the time with no trouble. I mention it *just in case* so clients are aware of the possibility and better prepared should that scenario happen. No one wants to be stuck in a copy center with screaming kids and a rude employee telling you no, right? Sounds kinda awful. Copyright releases are provided to help you print at these type of print services and prove you have that right, but ultimately it is at the print service employee&#39;s discretion no matter how wrong he or she is. Bringing in a receipt and copyright release to print services is recommended. And remember, problems are rare but it&#39;s better to be prepared, right? \r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT & FILE PROTECTION\r\nAll Three Little Monkeys Studio designs are protected by copyright. Infringement of any kind will not be tolerated and infringers will be prosecuted. Logos and copyright notice may not be removed from any Three Little Monkeys Studio designs. \r\n\r\nFiles are locked to prevent infringement and alteration, this includes resizing, copying graphics, and anything that alters the design. Locking does not prevent you from printing your files at the size and in the way they were created for. Please refer to your instructions for tips and information pertinent to your order.\r\n\r\nAny Etsy shops who steals Three Little Monkeys Studio designs will be reported and prosecuted.","policy_seller_info":" ","policy_updated_tsz":1406777117,"vacation_autoreply":"Thank you for your message!

(holiday hours vary)  We use USPS First Class and Priority mail to provide our customers with the quickest and most cost effective shipment.  In most cases, your item will be shipped on the same or next business day after payment clears.  In the rare instance that your order won&#39;t be shipping within that time frame, we will contact you via Etsy messages.\r\n\r\nShipping cut-off on Saturday is 11am Central Standard Time based on when our post office closes for the day.  Any orders placed after this time will be shipped on Monday (excluding holidays).\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------SHIPPING ADDRESSES--------------------------------------\r\nWe print our shipping labels directly through Etsy.  We will always ship to your Etsy address unless specified otherwise (such as gift orders). Please verify at the time of checkout that this information is up to date.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------SHIPPING COSTS------------------------------------------\r\nShipping rates may be found on our shipping page and on the individual item listing.  Pattern booklets ship free within the US (via first class mail), all other patterns ship for $2 in the US (via first class mail) when ordered alone, and all other items ship for only $5.85 (via priority mail) on all US orders, no matter how much you order!\r\n\r\n*Patterns up to 13oz ship First Class mail via USPS.\r\n*Fabric, rulers and templates ship Priority Flat Rate mail via USPS.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in expedited shipping, insurance, or shipping via UPS\/FedEx, please send us a conversation\/message via Etsy before ordering. Once you have agreed to the new shipping costs, a custom listing will be created for you.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------SHIPPING TIMES-----------------------------------------\r\nShip times vary according to USPS based on holidays, heavy mailing periods, and  destination.  We will do our part to ship orders to you within 1-2 business days of your order.  US orders typically arrive within 2-7 business days of shipment depending on the product, destination, and type of postage.  Once an order has left with our mailman, speed of delivery is determined by USPS.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------TRACKING & INSURANCE------------------------------------\r\nWe automatically ship with tracking for both First Class and Priority mail.  $100 of insurance is automatically included for purchases shipped Priority mail (all fabric purchases).  If you would like insurance on your First Class package, or additional insurance on a priority mail package please contact us before purchasing so we may create a custom listing for a shipping insurance upgrade.\r\n\r\nFIRST CLASS MAIL INFORMATION:\r\nTracking on First Class Mail does not update on the USPS website as frequently as Priority Flat Rate Mail does.  If there has not been movement on a package, we will do our best to get a status update from USPS, and if necessary file claims within their guidelines. Claims filed without insurance often do not have the same results as claims for insurance. If you are concerned about mail getting to you, please speak to us prior to purchasing about additional insurance.\r\n\r\nPRIORITY MAIL INFORMATION:\r\nClaims for insurance cannot be filed until 45 days (from shipment) have lapsed according to USPS rules.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS----------------------------------\r\nCost for international shipping varies based on weight and destination country.  We will do our best to provide you with the most cost effective shipping, and any overages in shipping will be refunded.\r\n\r\nTracking on packages typically show through the USPS website until it leaves the US.  Once the package has left the US, tracking availability is determined by your country&#39;s postal system.  If you are concerned about a package getting to you internationally, we strongly recommend that you purchase insurance.  Insurance is available for roughly an additional $2.00 per $100 of product.\r\n\r\n***Please note: customs fees may be assessed depending on your country.
